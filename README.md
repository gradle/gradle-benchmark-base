# Gradle Benchmark Base

Base scenarios to be used with [Gradle Profiler](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-profiler) to measure performance of Gradle builds.

1. Check this repo out _next to_ the project you want to benchmark. Alternatively you can add both this repo and the project repo as sibling Git submodules.
2. Follow the steps in the comments at the top of the scenario file. For now we only have [`incremental-base.conf`](incremental-base.conf).
